/**
 * Nilo web Worker -- SPA routing with proper MIME-type handling.
 *
 * Moved here from `public/_worker.js` when the app left Cloudflare Pages for a
 * Worker. The behaviour it exists for is unchanged, and so is the reason:
 * `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` serves index.html for ANY
 * miss, including a stale hashed bundle. A browser asked for `.js` and handed
 * `text/html` rejects it, so this returns a real 404 for asset extensions
 * instead.
 *
 * It runs ONLY on a miss. `run_worker_first` is unset, so the asset router
 * serves anything matching a real file without invoking this script — which is
 * why the immutable-caching branch that used to live here was removed rather
 * than kept: it could never fire for an asset that exists. `public/_headers`
 * sets those headers, and Workers static assets honours it.
 *
 * It must keep running as a Worker script rather than becoming Pages Advanced
 * Mode again: `public/_worker.js` was only ever loaded by Pages.
